      <h2 class="normal">What makes a Fun Video Game?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><h3 class="normal">Gameplay</h3><p>A fun game would include unique gameplay mechanics, such as stealth, action, ai, movement and much more, they would also include easy controls that an average player can pick up and get used to pretty quickly, the gameplay should be easy to learn and hard to master! </p></li>
		<li><h3 class="normal">Story</h3><p>A fun game's story is very dependant on what the game is about, if it's very simple and there is not actual lore needed to understand anything about the game then the story is useless but if the game really relies on the story for the gameplay then story should atleast be understandable and well written!</p></li>
      	<li><h3 class="normal">Graphics</h3><p>A fun game's graphics and sound is super important as this makes the environment the player is in a fun and appropiate atmosphere!</p></li>
		<li><h3 class="normal">Replayability</h3><p>A fun game's replayability could be achieved with a fun campaign, fun side missions (eg. mgs vr missions, boss rush modes) or achievements that can players can get for an epic reward</p></li>
		<li><h3 class="normal">Innovation</h3><p>A new game should always innovate from the old product, games nowadays are just dlc mmo cash-grabs just to keep the shareholders happy, but the best games are the ones that innovate and improve from the previous!</p></li>

		<h1 class="normal"> Reviewers Opinions</h1>
		<p class="normal">1. I like the Gameplay and Advanced Enemy AI (not the gw ai from the story) I think the controls are good and easy to use since it's top down and it feels like a twin stick shooter without the twin stick shooter and you can switch to first person for targeting far objects your top down camera can't render like off-screen or over the camera targets and the enemies super advanced tactical AI!</p>
				<p class="normal">2. I think the graphics is pretty good for a 2001 game (Basically 1 year after the PS2's release) and the details were amazing with hair physics, bandana physics and on the characters like Solid Snake, Raiden, Enemies and everything else!</p>

		<p class="normal">3. I think the story in the plant chapter is a bit hard to follow, as it's very confusing with the metal gear solid timeline but I suppose it's meant to be confusing as when you find out about GW AI, you are gonna be even more confused, but I like the beginning of the plant chapter story and the tanker story!</p>
